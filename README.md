# IMAGE-BASED-AUTHENTICATION
An authentication technique called "graphical passwords" substitutes images for alphanumeric characters in passwords. Since people typically recall visuals better than text, they are visually appealing. This project includes a secure graphical authentication system that guards against shoulder surfing attacks when users enter passwords in public.
